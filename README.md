In this project, I worked with MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose ODM to build an API for a social networking web application. The objective was to allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The API was structured using Express.js for routing and a MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM. Additionally, I used a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps. Since no seed data was provided, I created my own data using Insomnia after building the API. This project allowed me to understand the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications, with a focus on building and structuring the API.
